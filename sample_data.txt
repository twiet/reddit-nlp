I didn't bother complaining to Fox, instead I sent this e-mail to head of the NH GOP:\n\n&gt; Fergus,\n\n&gt; As I\u2019m sure you are aware, Dr. Paul has been excluded from the Fox News roundtable forum. I think the New Hampshire GOP should issue a press release condemning Fox News for imposing their political views on their election coverage. \n\n&gt; Paul is a legitimate candidate, certainly more so than Fred Thompson, who was included in the Fox forum. Paul has out-raised every other GOP candidate this quarter, his poll numbers recently entered double-digits, and they continue to rise rapidly.\n\n&gt; I hope you will keep the playing field level and fair by issuing a press release.

He seems to be the only honest man in Presidential politics today, and seems worth electing for that reason alone.  Now, he's the first candidate I suggest to people who don't follow politics.\r\n\r\nThat said, headlines like these remind me why I'm so uncomfortable with him.  \"Absolute faith\" in anything seems pretty scary.  And his ideas about free markets deserve some scrutiny.  The modern market of corporations is not American, not enshrined in the constitution, and seems to me one of the poisons that is destroying America.\r\n\r\nThis country lives and breathes because of ideas that modern American politics deems socialist, that have no place in a pure free market system.  Consider that the internet was created by a socialist system (publicly funded research) - and we had at least 3 major tries by private entities, all horrible because they were proprietary.  Consider our knowledge of physics and modern biology.  And there are many, many examples like this - we just dont speak about them, or call them socialist.  The end result of a long propaganda campaign by free market idealogues.  \r\n\r\nAnd don't free markets require some social infrastructure to exist?  Laws to enforce property rights, a police force that enables a creditor to collect on what society deems he \"owns\"?  It seems fairly arbitrary to decide that property rights supersede all other social goods.  This is a philosophy which worships at the altar of selfishness and which is tearing up our social fabric.", "Kucinich", "I'm in agreement w/ Kucinich on almost all the issues. And thought about working for his campaign back in 2000, but only attended some meetings.  Back then, he wasn't so polished, and gave the impression of someone who is a bit credulous or naive. I think this still dogs him a bit, though his delivery has much improved.\r\n\r\nI'd vote for him in a heartbeat over Paul, were it to come to that in some alternate universe.  \r\n"]}, "label": "politics"}
