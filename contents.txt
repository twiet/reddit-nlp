The engineering and business history of a successful OODBMS 
Apparently, Bush's problem is that we haven't been praying for him enough. NO HIS PROBLEM IS THAT WE HAVE NOT GOT HIM ON TRIAL FOR WAR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY BRO, THATS THE FUCKING PROBLEM An anagram for the author of the letter is "I Viva Beer."
Does Hillary Clinton realize that if she wins the white house, she will spend each day in the office where her husband cheated on her ? Yeah, but she can cheat on him there now with her lesbian lover whats that chicks name again? No, not Condi....the other one... You bet. And she is probably thinking she can nab the rest of the furniture this time around.
New Hampshire GOP Issues Press Release Condemning Fox News For Excluding Ron Paul Fox News what a joke of a network. I didn't bother complaining to Fox, instead I sent this e mail to head of the NH GOP: Fergus, As I’m sure you are aware, Dr. Paul has been excluded from the Fox News roundtable forum. I think the New Hampshire GOP should issue a press release condemning Fox News for imposing their political views on their election coverage. Paul is a legitimate candidate, certainly more so than Fred Thompson, who was included in the Fox forum. Paul has out raised every other GOP candidate this quarter, his poll numbers recently entered double digits, and they continue to rise rapidly. I hope you will keep the playing field level and fair by issuing a press release. Thank you. Regards, me I CONDEM RON PAUL FOR BEING A RACIST NEO CON AND HOW ABOUT THAT? I didn't even know you were a jedi. Good call. Are you LiberalConservative of K5 fame? WHATS K5 FAME?
The Ron Paul issue..... Or What Ron Paul May or May Not Have To Offer A WV Independent RON PAUL IS A FACIST RACIST SCUM WHO GETS DONATIONS FROM KKK
An Absolute Faith In Free Markets And Less Government CAPITALISM IS WHAT HAS DESTROYED AMERICA BRO, ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR EVER LOVING MIND? You know, I was dead set against RP early on, but seeing his interviews and speeches has changed my mind. He seems to be the only honest man in Presidential politics today, and seems worth electing for that reason alone. Now, he's the first candidate I suggest to people who don't follow politics. That said, headlines like these remind me why I'm so uncomfortable with him. "Absolute faith" in anything seems pretty scary. And his ideas about free markets deserve some scrutiny. The modern market of corporations is not American, not enshrined in the constitution, and seems to me one of the poisons that is destroying America. This country lives and breathes because of ideas that modern American politics deems socialist, that have no place in a pure free market system. Consider that the internet was created by a socialist system publicly funded research and we had at least 3 major tries by private entities, all horrible because they were proprietary. Consider our knowledge of physics and modern biology. And there are many, many examples like this we just dont speak about them, or call them socialist. The end result of a long propaganda campaign by free market idealogues. And don't free markets require some social infrastructure to exist? Laws to enforce property rights, a police force that enables a creditor to collect on what society deems he "owns"? It seems fairly arbitrary to decide that property rights supersede all other social goods. This is a philosophy which worships at the altar of selfishness and which is tearing up our social fabric. Kucinich I'm in agreement w Kucinich on almost all the issues. And thought about
What costs more: Global Natural Disasters or America's War on Drugs? WHAT ABOUT THE WAR ON IRAQIS CHILDREN THAT BUSH TAKES PART IN? HOW MANY 10'S OF MILLIONS OF IRAQI KIDS HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF BUSH? were they doing drugs? WHAT FOOL?

Republicans Don't Like What Paul Is Saying And They Told Their Boy Ailes To Shut Him Down. They Aren't Even Trying To Hide It. And who does this surprise? Fuck the republicans. They're toast. Paul should run as an independent. Choosing to stand with the criminals while claiming to be different isn't doing him any favors. If he did, he couldn't be on the ballot in many states. The system is rigged against 3rd parties independents. In some, if you are on the ballot in the primary in one party, you can't be in the general under another. I'm not even trying to hide it. I don't care who our next president is, as long as it isn't Wrong Paul. That's what you Paultards get for being the biggest bastards to ever hit the Internet. And it isn't over after the election, either. I've made a list of every Paultard I can find, and I'm never dropping this grudge. If I get it my way, the stigma of having been a member of the Paultard Inquisition will follow you for the rest of your life, and people will mutter the word Paultard over your grave afterwards. Paultards are the Nazis of our time. 
The 'Nobody Knows' US election 
Huckabee Has Anti War Protesters Arrested He needs to have his political career arrested. THE POLICE STATE IS HERE PEOPLE CANT YOU SEE WHATS HAPPENING? CANT YOU GUYS SEE WHERE THIS IS FUCKING HEADED? WE MUST STOP THEM BEFORE THEY GAIN TOO MUCH POWER AND WE END UP IN HALLIBURTON CONCENTRATION CAMPS Buh Dum Chh...? Or should I crack another witty pun? Go for the pun, you can never go wrong. I think a neat feature for Reddit would be the ability to submit new titles to articles and have the titles voted. IHMO this one should have read: Huckabee Has Anti War Protesters Arrested for Trespassing in His Office

FOX, ABC To Reduce Debate Fields I'm fairly certain Thompson doesn't meet those qualifications... It's not their job to trim the debate fields. Paul should meet one of those at least. Paul will meet one; not to worry. As much as I hate to admit it, Paul probably does meet at least one qualification, so he would have reason to complain.
Guiliani Admits He Takes "Too Much" Credit for NYC Security 
The lesson of history is clear. If you want to stop war then starve the state, the military and their accompanying religious priesthoods. Unfortunately in America it seems not enough people give a shit if their country is being overrun by morons. Stopping the state means stopping leftists. Leftists are the only ones who have used the state to start their murderous campaigns. 
The Cults of Programming Kernel hacking cult believe their application must run in kernel space. A good article. However, he misses out on the "turing completeness cult" ­ fools who state that it doesn't matter what language something is created in, because all programming languages are theoretically equivalent. Frequently seen in PHP and Visual Basic programmers, and I'm not quite sure how to cure it. Force them to write Hello World in Java, Python, and Haskell on the blackboard. The "Cult" metaphor is used very poorly and for polemical reasons only in the article. It doesn't add anything to understand programmers convictions.
